For the "Simple Text-based Adventure Game" project, here are some recommended classes to create, keeping the principles of object-oriented programming in mind:

1. **Game**
    - Game main loop
    - Game initialization and termination
    - Player interaction handling
    - Story progression

2. **Player**
    - Attributes: `name`, `health`, `inventory`, `location`, `score`, etc.
    - Methods: `move()`, `inspect()`, `useItem()`, `talkToCharacter()`, etc.

3. **Room**
    - Attributes: `description`, `items`, `exits`, `characters`, etc.
    - Methods: `enter()`, `leave()`, `addItem()`, `removeItem()`, `describe()`, etc.

4. **Item**
    - Attributes: `name`, `description`, `usable`, `effect`, etc.
    - Methods: `inspect()`, `use()`, `pickUp()`, `drop()`, etc.

5. **Character (NPCs)**
    - Attributes: `name`, `description`, `dialogue`, `quest`, etc.
    - Methods: `talk()`, `giveQuest()`, `rewardPlayer()`, etc.

6. **Quest**
    - Attributes: `description`, `requirements`, `completed`, `reward`, etc.
    - Methods: `assignToPlayer()`, `complete()`, `checkStatus()`, etc.

7. **Inventory**
    - Attributes: `items`, `capacity`
    - Methods: `addItem()`, `removeItem()`, `listItems()`, etc.

8. **Dialogue**
    - Attributes: `lines`, `responses`, `triggerEvent`
    - Methods: `display()`, `chooseResponse()`, etc.

9. **Exit**
    - Attributes: `direction`, `destination`, `locked`, `keyRequired`
    - Methods: `traverse()`, `lock()`, `unlock()`, etc.

10. **Utility**
    - Methods: `print()`, `pause()`, `clearScreen()`, `getInput()`, etc.
    - This class can have static methods that assist in various repetitive tasks or UI-related functions.

Remember, these are basic suggestions to get started. As the game's complexity grows, more classes or subclasses can be added. For instance, you might have subclasses under `Item` like `Weapon`, `Potion`, and `Key`, each with specific attributes and methods.

It's also important to consider design patterns when building games. For example, the **State Pattern** can be helpful in managing game states like `Start`, `Playing`, `Paused`, and `GameOver`.

Organizing classes in this manner will provide a structured foundation, making the game easier to expand, maintain, and debug.
