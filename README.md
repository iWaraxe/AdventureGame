**Project #2 - Simple Text-based Adventure Game**

### Overview:
Expand on your programming skills by crafting a text-based adventure game that includes unique characters, each with their own specific attributes and behaviors. This project will allow you to dive deeper into OOP concepts, creating a game where players can navigate through different scenarios, make choices, and interact with various characters.

### Objectives:
1. **Character Creation** - Define a set of characters for your game.
2. **Attributes & Behaviors** - Assign attributes (like health, strength, intelligence) and behaviors (like talk, attack) to your characters.
3. **Game Progression** - Develop a storyline with various choices leading to different outcomes.
4. **Interactivity** - Allow players to make decisions that affect the game's progression.

### Task Details:

1. **Setting up the Game World**
    - Outline the game world's structure. What does it look like? Is it a medieval castle, a futuristic space station, or something entirely different?
    - Determine the different locations or scenes players can explore.

2. **Character Design**
    - Define a base character class that includes basic attributes such as name, health, strength, and intelligence.
    - Derive subclasses for specific character types (e.g., Warrior, Wizard, Alien). Customize attributes and methods for each subclass.
    - Implement behaviors for each character type, such as `talk()`, `attack()`, `defend()`, or `castSpell()`.

3. **User Interaction**
    - Implement a simple command parser that can understand player input like "talk", "move north", or "attack".
    - Depending on the user's input and current game state, respond appropriately by invoking character methods or updating the game state.

4. **Game Progression & Choices**
    - Craft a storyline with different branching paths based on player decisions.
    - Consider scenarios like, what happens if a player decides to talk to a character vs. attacking them?
    - Implement various outcomes depending on players' choices and character interactions.

5. **Winning & Losing**
    - Define conditions under which a player can win or lose the game. It could be based on achieving a certain goal, reaching a specific location, or surviving challenging encounters.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Code Structure & Organization** - Is the code well-organized, utilizing OOP principles effectively? Is there a clear distinction between classes, objects, and methods?
- **Functionality** - Does the game work without bugs or errors? Are user inputs processed correctly, leading to the appropriate game responses?
- **Story Complexity** - While the game's storyline doesn't need to rival epic novels, it should be engaging and provide players with meaningful choices.
- **Interactivity** - The game should provide feedback based on user actions and evolve based on player decisions.

### Submission Guidelines:
1. Submit all your source code files.
2. Include a brief document detailing your game's storyline, main characters, and possible outcomes.
3. If possible, provide a flowchart illustrating the game progression and branching paths based on player choices.

**Bonus Challenge:** For those looking for an extra challenge, consider adding features like an inventory system, more complex combat mechanics, or integrating random events that can occur as the player progresses.
